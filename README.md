- BUT, if the player rolls a 1, he loses all of his ROUND score. After that, it's the next player's turn
- The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that his ROUND score is added to his GLOBAL score. The turn is then passed to the next player
- The first player to reach 100 points on GLOBAL score wins the game!

SPECIAL RULE:
- Unlike the standard pig game, in this game, if the current player rolls 6 twice in a row, he loses all of his points for both the round and the game and the turn is passed to the other playe

ADDITIONAL OPTION:
- Either player can set the winning score for the game to be different than the default score of 100 points by inputting the desired final score in the blank field provided in the center of the screen.
